# WELCOME

We are Rodney + Jodi Gehman, visual creative artists located in the heart of the midwest! We are visual artists, with experience in photography, cinema, and design. We're also mom and dad to four children, and a dog named Berkeley. This website is the front door into our life, and we're eager to share it with you! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fd556238-e3ea-481c-9b35-75c624215084.jpg)
