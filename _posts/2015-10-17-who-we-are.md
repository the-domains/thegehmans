# WHO WE ARE

We are Rodney + Jodi Gehman, visual creative artists located in the heart of the midwest! We are mom and dad to four children, and a dog named Berkeley. This website is the front door into our life, and we're eager to share it with you! We spent 12 years operating an in-home photography + cinematography studio, but these days Jodi home schools the kids while Rodney is the Music Director at our church.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fd556238-e3ea-481c-9b35-75c624215084.jpg)
