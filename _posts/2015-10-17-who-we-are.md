# WHO WE ARE

We are Rodney + Jodi Gehman, visual creative artists located in the heart of the midwest! We are mom and dad to four children, and a dog named Berkeley. This website is the front door into our life, and we're eager to share it with you! 

We spent 12 years operating an in-home photography + cinematography studio, but these days Jodi home schools the kids while Rodney is the Music Director at our church.  You can learn more about our photography by clicking the link above, and we'll continue to add other projects as they come along. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fd556238-e3ea-481c-9b35-75c624215084.jpg)
