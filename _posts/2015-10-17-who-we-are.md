# WHO WE ARE

We are Rodney + Jodi Gehman, visual creative artists located in the heart of the midwest! We are mom and dad to four children, and a dog named Berkeley. This website is the front door into our life, and we're eager to share it with you! We spent 12 years operating an in-home photography + cinematography studio, but these days Jodi home schools the kids while Rodney is the Music Director at [our church][0].  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fd556238-e3ea-481c-9b35-75c624215084.jpg)

Even though we aren't photographing as much as we once did, our passion is still to create visual art that stirs hearts and inspires. 

Thanks for stopping by... hope to meet you soon!
