# Roasting Coffee

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3693c0fa034e507b551a2e48552db1215cbc2116.jpg" /></article>

# COFFEE

I remember the first time I drank coffee.  It was at a Christmas banquet of some kind; I think I was 17 or so.  I asked the waiter for a coffee, and felt like this was part of my "coming-of-age" story.  Upon first sip, I immediately questioned my choice, and wondered how anyone could ever like this stuff.  But I figured it must be an acquired taste, and my plans were to acquire it! 

20+ years later, I've come to realize that coffee is not just a drink. It is an experience. There is so much more to coffee than the black water I drank that day.  These days, I drink ALOT of coffee, but it's not for the energy kick or the caffeine buzz.  

I drink coffee for the challenge and the thrill of a perfect cup. 

Now, as a believer that Jesus Christ is the only place true joy and peace is found, I am confident that no matter how good a brew I can produce, it will never achieve lasting happiness or joy.  But I believe that coffee is a good gift from a Father who cares about his children, and has given us coffee for our enjoyment and delight... so long as we receive it thankfully.
